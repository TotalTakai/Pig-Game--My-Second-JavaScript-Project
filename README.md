# Pig-Game--My-Second-JavaScript-Project

'Pig Game' is a game meant for 2 players.
The goal of the game is to be the player that gets to 100 points first.

Each turn you can roll a dice, and either store the value of your dice (HOLD)
or you can keep on rolling to get an higher sum to store (HOLD).

The problem is, if you roll a 1, you won't be able to store anything this round.

Your turn ends when you either choose to store your value (HOLD) or if you role a '1'.
